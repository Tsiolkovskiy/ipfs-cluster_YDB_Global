# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification describes the integration of IPFS Cluster with the ZFS file system for handling one trillion (10^12) pins. The system must provide high performance, reliability, and scalability when working with extremely large data volumes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Scalable Metadata Storage

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to store metadata for one trillion pins efficiently, so that the system can scale without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a pin addition request THEN metadata SHALL be stored in a ZFS dataset with response time less than 10ms
2. WHEN the number of pins exceeds 1 billion THEN the system SHALL automatically create new ZFS datasets for sharding
3. WHEN a pin search by CID is performed THEN search time SHALL not exceed 5ms regardless of total pin count
4. IF the system reaches 80% ZFS pool capacity THEN an alert SHALL be automatically created and pool expansion SHALL be initiated

### Requirement 2: Optimized Indexing and Search

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want to quickly find pins by various criteria, so that I can ensure user interface responsiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CID search is performed THEN the system SHALL use ZFS deduplication for storage optimization
2. WHEN a pin index is created THEN ZFS snapshots SHALL be used for data consistency
3. WHEN bulk pin import is performed THEN the system SHALL use ZFS compression for space efficiency
4. IF the index becomes fragmented THEN defragmentation SHALL automatically start using ZFS scrub

### Requirement 3: High-Performance Replication

**User Story:** As a cluster operator, I want to replicate data between nodes efficiently, so that I can ensure system fault tolerance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replication occurs between nodes THEN ZFS send/receive SHALL be used for incremental transfer
2. WHEN a node fails THEN recovery SHALL happen automatically using ZFS rollback
3. WHEN a new snapshot is created THEN it SHALL be automatically replicated to backup nodes
4. IF network connection is interrupted THEN replication SHALL resume from the last successful point

### Requirement 4: Monitoring and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor system status in real-time, so that I can prevent problems before they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN ZFS metrics SHALL be collected (ARC hit ratio, fragmentation, compression ratio)
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze ZFS statistics and suggest optimizations
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN detailed logs SHALL be created with ZFS debugging information
4. IF data corruption is detected THEN recovery procedure SHALL automatically start using ZFS checksums

### Requirement 5: Automatic Resource Management

**User Story:** As an infrastructure owner, I want to automatically manage system resources, so that I can minimize operational costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects access patterns THEN it SHALL automatically tune ZFS recordsize for optimization
2. WHEN data becomes "cold" THEN it SHALL be automatically moved to slower ZFS vdevs
3. WHEN more space is needed THEN the system SHALL automatically add new disks to the ZFS pool
4. IF unused space is detected THEN automatic cleanup SHALL run with ZFS trim

### Requirement 6: IPFS Cluster Consensus Integration

**User Story:** As a cluster developer, I want to integrate ZFS with IPFS Cluster CRDT consensus, so that I can ensure data consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CRDT operation occurs THEN changes SHALL be atomically written to ZFS dataset
2. WHEN a CRDT conflict arises THEN ZFS clones SHALL be used for conflict resolution
3. WHEN state rollback is required THEN ZFS snapshots SHALL be used for recovery
4. IF split-brain occurs THEN the system SHALL use ZFS checksums to determine the correct data version

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to ensure linear system scalability, so that it can handle growing workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new node is added THEN throughput SHALL increase linearly
2. WHEN the system processes 1 million operations per second THEN latency SHALL not exceed 50ms
3. WHEN ZFS L2ARC is used THEN hit ratio SHALL be at least 95% for hot data
4. IF the system reaches performance limits THEN ZFS tuning parameters SHALL be automatically applied

### Requirement 8: Security and Encryption

**User Story:** As a security specialist, I want to protect data from unauthorized access, using built-in ZFS capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is written THEN it SHALL be automatically encrypted using ZFS encryption
2. WHEN data access occurs THEN authentication SHALL be performed through ZFS delegation
3. WHEN a backup is created THEN it SHALL be encrypted using a separate key
4. IF unauthorized access attempt is detected THEN corresponding ZFS datasets SHALL be blocked
