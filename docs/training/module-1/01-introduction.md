# Module 1.1: Introduction to IPFS Cluster ZFS Integration

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of IPFS and IPFS Cluster
- Explain the benefits of ZFS integration
- Describe the system architecture at a high level
- Identify use cases for trillion-scale pin management

## What is IPFS?

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed, peer-to-peer protocol designed to create a permanent and decentralized method of storing and sharing files.

### Key Concepts

**Content Addressing:**
- Files are identified by their cryptographic hash (CID - Content Identifier)
- Same content always has the same CID
- Enables deduplication and verification

**Distributed Storage:**
- Files are stored across multiple nodes
- No single point of failure
- Improved availability and performance

**Immutable Data:**
- Content cannot be changed without changing its CID
- Provides data integrity guarantees
- Enables versioning and history tracking

### IPFS Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "IPFS Network"
        A[IPFS Node 1] <--> B[IPFS Node 2]
        B <--> C[IPFS Node 3]
        C <--> D[IPFS Node 4]
        A <--> D
    end
    
    subgraph "Applications"
        E[Web Browser] --> A
        F[Mobile App] --> B
        G[Server App] --> C
    end
```

## What is IPFS Cluster?

IPFS Cluster is a distributed application that provides data orchestration across a swarm of IPFS daemons by allocating, replicating, and tracking a global pinset distributed among multiple peers.

### Core Functions

**Pin Management:**
- Coordinates which content should be stored where
- Ensures replication requirements are met
- Tracks pin status across the cluster

**Consensus:**
- Maintains consistent state across cluster peers
- Handles peer failures and network partitions
- Supports both Raft and CRDT consensus algorithms

**Load Balancing:**
- Distributes pins across available peers
- Considers peer capacity and performance
- Enables horizontal scaling
